# Chronos-2
**Chronos-2** is a 120M-parameter, encoder-only time series foundation model for zero-shot forecasting.
It supports **univariate**, **multivariate**, and **covariate-informed** tasks within a single architecture.
Inspired by the T5 encoder, Chronos-2 produces multi-step-ahead quantile forecasts and uses a group attention mechanism for efficient in-context learning across related series and covariates.
Trained on a combination of real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, it achieves **state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy** among public models on [**fev-bench**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autogluon/fev-leaderboard), [**GIFT-Eval**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/GIFT-Eval), and [**Chronos Benchmark II**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815).
Chronos-2 is also **highly efficient**, delivering over 300 time series forecasts per second on a single A10G GPU and supporting both **GPU and CPU inference**.

## Overview

| Capability | Chronos-2 | Chronos-Bolt | Chronos |
|------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Univariate Forecasting | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cross-learning across items | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multivariate Forecasting | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Past-only (real/categorical) covariates | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Known future (real/categorical) covariates | ✅ | 🧩 | 🧩 |
| Max. Context Length | 8192 | 2048 | 512 |
| Max. Prediction Length | 1024 | 64 | 64 |

🧩 Chronos & Chronos-Bolt do not natively support future covariates, but they can be combined with external covariate regressors (see [AutoGluon tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-chronos.html#incorporating-the-covariates)). This only models per-timestep effects, not effects across time. In contrast, Chronos-2 supports all covariate types natively.


## Usage

### Local usage

For experimentation and local inference, you can use the [inference package](https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting).

Install the package
```
pip install "chronos-forecasting>=2.0"
```

Make zero-shot predictions using the `pandas` API

```python
import pandas as pd  # requires: pip install 'pandas[pyarrow]'
from chronos import Chronos2Pipeline

pipeline = Chronos2Pipeline.from_pretrained("amazon/chronos-2", device_map="cuda")

# Load historical target values and past values of covariates
context_df = pd.read_parquet("https://autogluon.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/timeseries/electricity_price/train.parquet")

# (Optional) Load future values of covariates
test_df = pd.read_parquet("https://autogluon.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/timeseries/electricity_price/test.parquet")
future_df = test_df.drop(columns="target")

# Generate predictions with covariates
pred_df = pipeline.predict_df(
    context_df,
    future_df=future_df,
    prediction_length=24,  # Number of steps to forecast
    quantile_levels=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9],  # Quantiles for probabilistic forecast
    id_column="id",  # Column identifying different time series
    timestamp_column="timestamp",  # Column with datetime information
    target="target",  # Column(s) with time series values to predict
)
```

### Deploying a Chronos-2 endpoint to SageMaker

For production use, we recommend deploying Chronos-2 endpoints to Amazon SageMaker.

First, update the SageMaker SDK to make sure that all the latest models are available.

```
pip install -U sagemaker
```

Deploy an inference endpoint to SageMaker.

```python
from sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel

model = JumpStartModel(
    model_id="pytorch-forecasting-chronos-2",
    instance_type="ml.g5.2xlarge",
)
predictor = model.deploy()
```

Now you can send time series data to the endpoint in JSON format.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AileenNielsen/TimeSeriesAnalysisWithPython/master/data/AirPassengers.csv")

payload = {
    "inputs": [
        {"target": df["#Passengers"].tolist()}
    ],
    "parameters": {
        "prediction_length": 12,
    }
}
forecast = predictor.predict(payload)["predictions"]
```
